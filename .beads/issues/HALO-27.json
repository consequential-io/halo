Based on the analysis:\n\nFor GOOD spend:\n- Recommend scaling budget by 30-100%\n- Estimate additional revenue potential\n\nFor BAD spend:\n- Recommend pausing or reducing budget by 50-100%\n- Calculate waste prevention\n\nFor creative fatigue:\n- Flag ads with high frequency (>3x avg)\n- Suggest creative refresh actions\n\nReturn structured recommendations with:\n- action: 'scale' | 'reduce' | 'pause' | 'refresh_creative'\n- amount: dollar or percentage change\n- reasoning: why this recommendation\n- impact: estimated $ impact\n```",
